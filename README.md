<h1>Generator Model Machine Learning Framework</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This is another framework hacked together to attempt to build a generator model, which, when trained on various shapes can draw its own shapes.
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>To test the tool:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First train the model by running `run_classifier_test.py`</li>
  <li>Then train the generator by running `run_generator_test.py`</li>
  <li>Eventually, it will output it's own circle, one that it drew from the distribution of circle images it was trained on</li>
</ol>
